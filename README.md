## 1. Introduction

The Encryption/Decryption App is a simple Python application that provides the functionality to encrypt and decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher. This app allows users to choose between encryption and decryption, input the message and shift value, and get the result.

## 2. Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt a message using a Caesar cipher with a specified shift value.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt an encrypted message using the same shift value.
- User-friendly command-line interface for input and output.

## 3. Installation

To use this app, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
```bash
git clone github.com/Freddy155/cryptography.git
```
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `app.py` file is located.
```bash 
cd cryptography
```


## 4. Usage

To run the Encryption/Decryption App, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located.
2. Run the following command to execute the app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The app will prompt you to choose between encryption (E) and decryption (D).

**For Encryption:**

1. Enter 'E' when prompted.
2. Input the message you want to encrypt.
3. Input the shift value (an integer) for the Caesar cipher.
4. The app will display the encrypted message.

**For Decryption:**

1. Enter 'D' when prompted.
2. Input the encrypted message you want to decrypt.
3. Input the shift value (the same one used for encryption).
4. The app will display the decrypted message.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform encryption or decryption.
